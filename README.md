## How to start project

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js v 14.15.0][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

```
npm install
```

2. To run the project you should use command:
```
npm run dev
```

By default project starts in http://localhost:8040/
